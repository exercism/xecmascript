# Design

## Learning objectives

- How to define a function
- All arguments are optional in JS
- What happens if the function is called with fewer or more arguments than mentioned in the function definition
- How to set default parameters
- Return an object if you want to return multiple values
- Pass by value vs. pass by reference
- Functions are first-class objects (can be assigned to variables, passed around etc.)
- Function scope
- What happens if there is no return statement

## Out of Scope

The following topics will be introduced later and should therefore not be part of this concept exercise.

- Rest parameters
- Callbacks
- Methods
- Arrow functions (will be introduced later together with callbacks)
- Recursion
- Closures
- Higher Order Functions

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `functions`

## Prerequisites

- `objects` FIXME
- `null-undefined` because they are needed for return values, default params etc.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules in the [analyzer][analyzer].
The comment types mentioned below only serve as a proposal.

1. `timeToMixJuice`

   - `essential`: ...

## Notes

The story was inspired by the [Lasagna Master Exercise in the Swift track][swift-lasagna-master].
