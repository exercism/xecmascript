# Hangman

Implement the logic of the hangman game using functional reactive programming.

Hangman is a simple word guessing game.

[Functional Reactive Programming][frp] is a way to write interactive
programs. It differs from the usual perspective in that instead of
saying "when the button is pressed increment the counter", you write
"the value of the counter is the sum of the number of times the button
is pressed."

Implement the basic logic behind hangman, optionally using functional 
reactive programming. No additional library is necessary.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Javascript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/javascript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have
completed the exercise.
